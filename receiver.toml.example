# tunnel-rs receiver configuration example
#
# Usage: tunnel-rs receiver --config receiver.toml --listen 127.0.0.1:2222
#
# All options can be overridden by CLI arguments.
# CLI arguments take precedence over config file values.
# Note: --listen is CLI-only and must always be provided.

# Protocol to tunnel: "tcp" or "udp"
protocol = "tcp"

# NodeId of the sender to connect to (required)
node_id = "2xnbkpbc7izsilvewd7c62w7wnwziacmpfwvhcrya5nt76dqkpga"

# Custom relay server URL(s) for failover
# Must match the sender's relay configuration
relay_urls = [
    "https://relay1.example.com",
    "https://relay2.example.com",
]

# Force all connections through relay (disables direct P2P)
# Requires relay_urls to be specified
relay_only = false
