# tunnel-rs server configuration example
#
# Usage: tunnel-rs server -c server.toml
#        tunnel-rs server --default-config
#
# Mode is inferred from the 'mode' field below.
# CLI arguments take precedence over config file values.
# This file is iroh-only. For ICE modes, see server_ice.toml.example.

# Required: validates config matches CLI command
role = "server"
mode = "iroh"

# NOTE: For iroh mode, do NOT set 'source' here.
# Clients request sources dynamically. Use allowed_sources below to restrict.

[iroh]
# Base64-encoded secret key for persistent identity (inline)
# secret = "base64..."
#
# Path to secret key file for persistent identity (use either secret or secret_file)
# Generate with: tunnel-rs generate-iroh-key --output server.key
# secret_file = "./server.key"

# Custom relay server URL(s) for failover
# If not provided, uses iroh's default public relays
relay_urls = [
    "https://relay1.example.com",
    "https://relay2.example.com",

# Custom DNS server URL for peer discovery
# Used with self-hosted iroh-dns-server for fully independent operation
# NOTE: URL must include the /pkarr path
# dns_server = "https://dns.example.com/pkarr"

# [Experimental] SOCKS5 proxy for relay connections
# Tor support is experimental and might not work reliably.
# REQUIRED: If relay_urls contain .onion addresses, MUST use socks5h:// for DNS through proxy
# OPTIONAL: For non-.onion relays, can use socks5:// or socks5h://
# Use with Tor: socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050
# socks5_proxy = "socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050"

# Maximum concurrent sessions (default: 100)
max_sessions = 100

# Authentication (REQUIRED)
# ============================================================================
# Clients must provide one of these tokens to connect.
# Generate secure tokens with: openssl rand -hex 16

# Authentication tokens (inline list)
auth_tokens = [
    "tunnel-abc123def456",  # Alice's token

# Or use a file (one token per line, # comments allowed)
# auth_tokens_file = "/etc/tunnel-rs/auth_tokens.txt"

# ============================================================================
# Allowed source networks that clients can request (CIDR notation)
# Clients MUST specify --source which must match one of these networks
# Separate lists for TCP and UDP protocols
# Supports IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR notation
